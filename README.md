# Andrew Nguyen
Welcome to my github! 👋

<p align="center">
  </p>

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at **Northeastern University** with a passion for building and securing intelligent, automated systems. My focus lies at the intersection of **Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Network Automation**.

**🚀 Exciting News!**
This summer (2025), I'll be joining **Microsoft** as a **Cloud Network Engineer Intern**, where I'm eager to contribute to the Azure Core team's innovative networking projects.

My journey from biochemistry research and network engineering to advanced ML applications has equipped me to tackle complex challenges in today's tech landscape. I'm driven to leverage data and automation to create robust, efficient, and secure solutions.
